### Junior Developer

I am a full stack developer and a sport enthusiast with determination and a great attitude.

I am looking for a junior developer position. I like to be in an environment that I am challenged, and continuously learning. I am fascinated about all the different programming languages and want to continue to learn more.

#### Working in a Team

Over the last two years, I have had the privilege of working extremely closely with people of a variety of different ages, nationalities and personalities in the yachting industry. The environment of the super yachts is one that is completely different to that of an office job. We were required to be able to work, live and socialise with our colleagues. Our hours are usually very long and could extend over a period of time. This created great pressure on the relationships between co-workers but professionalism was always required. It was the pressure and professionalism that forced me to develop my ability to be able to work with people in regular or high pressure situations.

#### Positive Attitude

I have had five employers in the past four years. They have ranged dramatically in leadership skills and experience. It is through this change in dynamic, that I realised the importance of a good attitude. My goal was and still is, to develop my attitude to fit the environment and situation I face. I have come a long way in the past four years, amongst the many important lessons I have learnt so far, four are:

- The only person to blame for ones actions is oneself.

- Supporting your leader goes further than undermining to prove oneself.

- To see a setback as a new challenge.

- Respect is not given its earned.

#### Attention for Detail

In my last two careers, attention to detail was a major requirement. As a swimming teacher, it was important to focus on the swimming technique, from head to toe position, in order to help a child to learn to swim. For the older children, it was all about improving their technique so that they could move quicker and more elegantly through the water. In swimming, every little detail matters regardless if you are learning to swim or trying to improve your skills.

In the yachting industry, you are working on yachts that could cost $20 million or more or being chartered at rate around $22 000 per week, depending largely on the size. Detail is everything. We would go out of our way to make everything perfect, from how we folded their clothes, to ironing there bed covers, to the placing of their plates. Top service requires great attention to detail.

#### Leadership

I managed the interior of a yacht while my Chief Stewardess was away. This included:
  - Organising and overseeing contractors, deliveries and crew.
  - Provisioning and securing the yacht for a 2 week journey over the Atlantic sea to the Caribbean.
